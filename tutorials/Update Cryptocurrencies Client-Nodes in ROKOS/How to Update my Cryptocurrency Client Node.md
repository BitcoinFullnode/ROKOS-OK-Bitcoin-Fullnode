## 2- Open a terminal in ROKOS, go to the folder where the new downloaded files are.

## 3- Give permissions and copy all the files to system by Typing for example if we are using okcash:

sudo cp okcash /usr/local/bin/

sudo cp okcashd /usr/local/bin/

* do with all the included download files except the *******.conf file.
