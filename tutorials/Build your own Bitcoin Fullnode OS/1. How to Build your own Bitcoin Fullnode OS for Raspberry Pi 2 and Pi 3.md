# Learn how to build your own Bitcoin Fullnode OS like ROKOS.

Steps to follow if you would like to build your own bitcoin fullnode platform, all commands are to be used in the command line (terminal):

**************

## 1- Distribution Image from RaspberryPi.org

The distribution version we need to flash on the SD card 
is the lastest Stable Raspbian Image from: 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

**************

## 2- Setup Raspbian in the Pi

a) Insert the flashed SD with Raspbian in the Raspberry Pi 2/3.

b) Plug in the USB mouse, the USB keyboard, the HDMI screen, the network cable, and the power cable.

The Raspberry Pi will boot for the first time and you will be presented with the Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config). 
To navigate in this tool, the useful keys are:
The up/down arrow, the Enter key, and the Tab key whenever the up/down arrow keys don’t do the job. 
Here, we will do next things:

b.1) Expand the Filesystem by choosing option 1 and Reboot.
You will get a message Root partition has been resized.

b.2) Select your Proper Time Zone and Change the User Password by choosing option 2. 
Enter your new password twice. 
When entering the password, the characters won’t be displayed as a security feature. 
You will get a message Password changed successfully.

We are done with the raspi-config tool. Select Finish and reboot the Pi.

Note: If you ever need to open the raspi-config tool again, simply type sudo raspi-config at the Terminal.

**************

## 3- Update the Raspberry Pi device.

Run the following commands:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

*When asked to do so, press the y key followed by the Enter key. 
You will need to that every time the message appears in the other steps below.

**************

## 4- Setting up the Raspberry Pi for compiling Bitcoin.

a) Change Swap Size.

Use the following command to change the default swap size:

sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile

Make sure it reads CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024
Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate the file.
After change is done, press Ctrl+O followed by the Enter key to save the file.
Then, press Ctrl+X to exit the editor.

Use the following commands to enable the swap file with its new size:

sudo dphys-swapfile setup

sudo dphys-swapfile swapon

You can check the new active swap size with next command:  

free -m

b) Install Required Dependencies with next commands:

sudo apt-get install autoconf libevent-dev libtool libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev git

b.1) If you want the graphicalfrontend, also install the following dependencies. 
If you just want bitcoind, you can skip this step.

sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev

c) Compile and Install BerkeleyDB 4.8.30 by running the following commands:

wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz

sudo tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz

cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix

../dist/configure --enable-cxx

make

sudo make install

export CPATH="/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/include"

export LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/lib"

Note: the export commands are only valid in the current Terminal session. 
To avoid errors, don't close the Terminal until you fully completed with Bitcoin compilation.

** if get an error do:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/lib/libdb-4.8.so /usr/lib/libdb-4.8.so

sudo ln -s /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/lib/libdb_cxx-4.8.so /usr/lib/libdb_cxx-4.8.so

**************

## 5- Clone the Bitcoin Github, compile and install the client / node with following commands:

git clone -b v0.13.0 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git

cd bitcoin

./autogen.sh

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/include -O2" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/lib" --enable-upnp-default --with-gui

make

sudo make install

**************

## 6- Restart/Reboot the system with:

sudo reboot

**************

## 7- Start the OS with:

startx

**************

## 8- open a terminal, you can start the bitcoin client with:

bitcoin-qt

or can start the bitcoin daemon with:

bitcoind

**************

## 9- Enjoy your Bitcoin Fullnode. 

**Optional steps to optimize the system:

Follow the tutorials:

2. Strip Down Raspbian Jessie for Raspberry Pi 2 and Pi 3.txt

3. Add Bitcoin client link to the Menu-Taskbar in Raspbian.txt (soon)

4. Bitcoin Datadir optimizations.txt (soon)
